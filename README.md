# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

My motivation was to create a weather application that could work with multiple location inputs. I built this project so it could help individuals wanting a weather forecast based on a specific location. This problem solves needing to refresh a page after every time someone wants to see the weather in a different location. I learned how to use APIs to display specific data on an application.
